Here are the business rules: • The Patients table stores data for individual patients. Each row represents a unique patient.  • The Health_conditions table stores data for a unique disease/health condition. Each row is unique and condition cannot be repeated in this table. However, multiple patients can have same health conditions.  • The Patient_Address table stores the address for each patient. Each address can belong to multiple patients e.g. People from a family will have the same address. Based on the above business rules, create appropriate relationships between the tables shown below. You can create new tables (to break any many to many relationships that may arise due to business rules) or add new columns to the existing tables to establish the relationships.

I have taught him Web Technology in his third year (2021 -22). \\nFrom what I have observed, he is diligent, sincere and really hardworking. He possesses exceptional \\nacademic potential and ambition that is way beyond the level at which most of the undergraduate \\nstudents perform.  \\nI must say that Sayam demonstrates an excellent interest in all his scholas tic pursuits and he is \\nextremely  committed and serious about his career. From the very first day of class, he impressed me \\nwith his vast knowledge about a variety of concepts. He was really attentive and focused on the \\nminutest things that were being taugh t and consistently asked several doubts regarding the topics. \\nHis willingness to learn and his immaculate dedication towards his studies is highly commendable. \\nHis assignments were always submitted timely and his work was precise and interesting to read. He \\nwas regular in attending classes and had a well -disciplined behaviour. Moreover, his performance in \\nthe class and sessional exams was incredible. During practical examinations, he astounded the \\nexaminers with his brief responses.  \\nAt a personal level, he has a pleasing personality as he exhibits excellent communication skills and \\nhis ability to connect with his peers and help them out with their doubts is completely unparalleled. \\nHe possesses great perseverance and never hesitates in adopting an initiative . He has an outstanding \\nability to adapt himself to a new and challenging environment. Furthermore, he possesses \\nmagnificent communication and interpersonal skills and is adored by all his batchmates.  \\nIn addition to his academic excellence, he was an IEEE  member in 2019 -20, where he actively \\nparticipated in all the events that were organised in the college. As an individual, he is active and \\nperseverant in both technical and cultural events. He has taken part in conducting several \\nworkshops and has attende d many seminars organised by the Department.  \\nSayam is an inquisitive and a special student who displays keen interest in gaining knowledge about \\nlatest advancements. He would be a tremendous addition to your university as he has the right \\nattitude and inte llect to excel and succeed in Graduate education . I feel very confident that if given \\nan opportunity, he will excel in his graduate studies and will prove to be an ideal candidate for your \\nesteemed university.  \\nI give him my strongest recommendation.  \\n \\nDr. Archana Kumar  \\nProfessor  \\nDepartment of Computer Science & Engineering  \\nMobile: 9810766992  \\nEmail: archna.kumar@adgitmdelhi.ac.in', metadata={'source': 'pdf_files\\\\LORs.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Here are the business rules: • The Patients table stores data for individual patients. Each row represents a unique patient.  • The Health_conditions table stores data for a unique disease/health condition. Each row is unique and condition cannot be repeated in this table. However, multiple patients can have same health conditions.  • The Patient_Address table stores the address for each patient. Each address can belong to multiple patients e.g. People from a family will have the same address. Based on the above business rules, create appropriate relationships between the tables shown below. You can create new tables (to break any many to many relationships that may arise due to business rules) or add new columns to the existing tables to establish the relationships. Please ensure that each table has a unique primary key that is not repeating and relationships are established by creating a Primary Key - Foreign key relationship.
